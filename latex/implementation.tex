\subsection{Backlog}

Out backlog changed a lot during the project. About halfway in, we was introduced to many new requirements from our customer Jaqueline Floch. We received a list where she had written down all her requirements in priorities for the project. This list was used during the acceptance testing and can be found in section \ref{sec:TestExecution} ordered by priority. This introduction also altered the priorities a bit, but was helpful as it made our customers wishes clearer after the unfortunate start of the project.
