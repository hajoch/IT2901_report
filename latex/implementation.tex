\subsection{Backlog}

Our backlog changed a lot during the project. About halfway in, we was introduced to many new requirements from our customer. We received a list where she had written down all her requirements for the project and prioritized them. This list was used during the acceptance testing and can be found in section \ref{sec:TestExecution} ordered by priority. This introduction also altered the priorities a bit, but was helpful as it made our customers vision clearer to us.
