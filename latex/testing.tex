\section{Testing}
\thispagestyle{plain}
System testing or software testing, falls into something that is called “Black-box testing”. This is a method of software testing, that investigates the functionality of the application. Eg. what it does, it is simply described as this:
It will not require to know how to code, or need any sufficient level of skill to programming when an system test is about to go down. It will neither interfere with it’s internal structure or workings. 

\subsection{Testing Procedure}

When you are about to conduct a test, you find a test-person. Then you tell them what the software is supposed to do. And give them the Test cases[7.2], and explain to them it is very important to think loud so we get the most out of the testing. 

\subsection{Test Cases}

Test cases are built around the specifications and requirements of the application. What the application is supposed to do.
