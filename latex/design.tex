\section{Introduction}
	\setcounter{page}{1}
		\paragraph{}
						\textit{This version of the report is just a preliminary and things such as long-term planning of the project, design, grammar, language and formatting is provided as is.}

						\paragraph{}

						\textit{Because of unfortunate events explained in the status report and the first meeting with the supervisor,  the group's first meeting with the customer happened a bit later than what would have been optimal. This will probably not lead to any long-term problems, but as of now the requirement specification has yet to be formalized and approved by the customer}

		\section{Description}
			\subsection{Objectives}
				\paragraph{}
The problem we are going to solve for our customer boils down to two main things. GUI and APIs. Stedr, as of now, have a very primitive UI. Sintef wants us to solve this problem by making the app look beautiful/modern and have a clean, easy-to-use interface. They imagine Stedr will be used by a lot of elders so this aspect is really important. To achieve this we, among other things,  plan to make good use of Google's Android Guidelines.
				\paragraph{}
The second problem is related to integration with different APIs. Sintef want Stedr to be integrated with social services such as Twitter, Flicker, Instagram, Facebook and Soundcloud. They have however not been very clear on how these services should be integrated.
				\paragraph{}
In addition to social media integration, the aspect of maintance is also very important for Sintef. They want the app to require as little maintainence as possible. They should in theory be able to launch the app and not touch it futher for many years. For this to become a realistic, it will be neccesary for us to avoid using backend solutions and thus not be dependent on maintaining a server.

			\subsection{The stedr application}
				\subsubsection{stedr's past}
				\paragraph{}
As of now, the current version of Stedr have the following functionality (AS IS):
				\begin{itemize}
\item Browse a map and zoom in and out.
\item Learn about places.
\item Click on a place in the map and get feedback.
\item Discover new places.
\item Read other peoples experiences of a place.
\item Get the users exact position on a map.
\item Search for places in map.
\item See which places are near me.
				\end{itemize}
				\subsubsection{stedr's future}
				\paragraph{}
And this is a list of functionality that Sintef want us to implement or at least consider (TO BE):
				\begin{itemize}
\item Share experiences and knowledge about a place.
\item Search for stories.
\item See others' experiences and reactions from social media.
\item Browse the app in an intuitive way.
\item Mark a spot on the map as a new place.
\item Watch videos and sound from a specific place.
\item Search by taking a picture.
\item Find relevant hashtags for a place.
\item Read dictionary/wiki input about a place.
\item Get route description.
"Streetview" a place.
				\end{itemize}
			\subsection{Alternatives}
				\paragraph{}
Since the application originally was developed by a group of computer engineering students during the fall semester 2013, there already exists an updated analysis of competetive technologies. As far as our research shows, there hasn't been released any new technologies since the application was developed. The original report and therefore also the competetive analysis is not made publically available, but it can be produced upon request. 
		
		\section{Team Organization}
			\subsection{Responsobility Areas}
				\paragraph{}
Delegating responsibility areas are important so that someone at all times have an overview over what tasks that needs to be done in specific areas. This also makes it easier to estimate workloads and delegate tasks during the group meetings. It is important to note that even though there are specific responsibility areas, all the group members will be able to get practical experience in all of the project areas, even though the time spent in different areas will be distributed individually according to the responsobility areas.

				\end{description}

			\subsection{Process model}
				\paragraph{}
For the process model we chose to use the SCRUM framework. This was the most natural choice for us amongst the agile methods since it’s a system we all have experience with through previous projects. There are many advantages working with SCRUM. It gives clear priority for features and deadlines, which will allow us to focus more of our energy on other vital tasks. This approach promotes communication and transparency. All the team members as well as the client always know what’s going on and the current tasks’ development through the product backlog. With the backlog cards, the whole production team is also involved with the overall time estimate, which makes it fairly accurate and controllable.
				\paragraph{}
We considered a few other methods as well, like kanban and XP, but came to the conclusion that SCRUM was the system for us. This was due to SCRUMS many structured rules which brings order, but still allows us the freedom we might need during the projects development.
				\paragraph{}
With SCRUM we’ll work in iterations called “Sprints” which are typically a week or two, we also stibe towards making these sprints incremental. Doing this the model is designed, implemented and tested incrementally, feature by feature, until the project is finished. The advantage here is that for every sprint we have a working product to show for, which is a good referance to have, both for ourselves and the customer. 
				\paragraph{}
Since we already have a working project from the very beginning for us to further develop, there is some obvious phase partitions. The first consists mainly on assessing the current version of the product and define the path ahead before we start the actual programming. This will be done through thorough dialog and discussion with SINTEF, to give us a unison idea of where the product are heading. User evaluation is also important in this phase, both internally and externally within the target user group. And of course technology and framework selection. After this comprehensive planning, the actual coding phase can begin. The sprints will be a big part this, and since we are working incrementally; so will testing. Following this: the evaluating phase. In which user tests hopefully will force as many problems and bugs with the early version to surface, for us to correct.
				\paragraph{}
Prototypes through a digital mock-up will be important in the planning phase. We have chosen to use Balsamiq for that mission, and through this we’ll have an interactive prototype mock-up to show the customer, and should also make sure were all on the same page, which is easier having something concrete/”physical” as a reference.

			\subsection{Development Environment}
				\paragraph{}
Since our project is based on further developing an existing product, there’s an advantage in using the same main framework for developing as product is based on. We decided to do this; use Titanium to easily develop a multi-platform app, but we also took a close look at other options (like phonegap) and compared them meticulously in their most critical aspects. With the Titanium framework we use the Titanium SDK which is based on eclipse but tailored for it. For sharing code Git was our system of choice, mainly because we were already familiar with it, and know it has all the functionality we could need throughout the project. Other documents and files, like notes, summaries, etc. we decided to share through a dedicated Google Drive and Dropbox folder, because each has its own big advantages in different aspects. As SCRUM service we choose Agilefant.
				\paragraph{}
This project obviously involves working with a big set of APIs, like social media, dictionary and other media services. These’ll play a great part of the development and introduce other frameworks we’ll have to account for. For communication we often use mail and chat-services, but prefer more “personal” forms of communication like a video chat through skype, phone calls and/or ideally, meetings in person.

					\paragraph{}
						
					\begin{description}
						\item[Continue developing on the existing platform] \hfill \\
						The application is developed with the Titanium SDK to maintain and continuing the development of the application ours also have to be that.
						\item[Preferably no backend] \hfill \\
						The customer does not want to maintain a backend. This also have a privacy perspective. 
						\item[Compiled multi-platform application]  \hfill \\
						As of today the application is compiled so that it can be added to Apple Store and Google Play.
						\item[Application for mobile devices]  \hfill \\
						The application is meant for smartphones and should not have a web interface.
