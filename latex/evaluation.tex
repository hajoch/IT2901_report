\section{Evaluation}

	\subsection{Process}

With our process modell, Scrum, we found that following it by the book, became very troublesome. Therfore we decided to make some modification to the original model. The main problem with using Scrum by the letter is that we are all students, and this project only counts for half of the semesters study points. This means we all have different schedules, and thus making it difficult to have daily meetings. End meetings, or retrospective meetings is also something we haven’t prioritized much.

In Scrum it is common to use something called planning poker when deciding how long tasks should take. This essentially means that everyone “votes” on how time consuming they think a given task will be. We found this to be a little unnecessary because its usually so imprecise, and have therefore chosen to just let the persons responsible give their judgements to save time. 

	\subsection{Project Management}

One of the main challenges for us concerning project management was the frequent changes made in regards to features. It also took a while to come to a shared view on the requirements with our customer. Later in the project, the customer provided us with a long list with about 50 features that was to be implemented. We ended up treating requirements different from this feature list. This was because, even though our requirements addressed much of the features in the feature list, they were still on a another abstract level. The feature list items was too detailed and specific to be listed as requirements.

	\subsection{Communication}

We feel that the communication internally on the team have been good. By using different channels like Facebook, mail, and phone, we were able to stay in touch throughout the project even though we couldn't always be physically present on the school.

With the customer on the other hand, the communication could have been handled better on both parts. 

Our customer went on an unfortunate sick leave at the start of the project, which ment that our communication had to go through a third party. At first, it didn't seem like a big problem, but when we later discovered how this had led to major misunderstandings, it ended up hurting us more than we first thought it would.

About three weeks into the project, we started to have direct communication with our customer over skype once a week. These meetings didn't work well for us. It made it hard for everybody to engage in the conversations. Altough we always paid attention and were careful to write summaries from these meetings, the customer's visions didn't get trough to us somehow. We thought we had a clear picture of what our customer wanted, but it turned out to be wrong.

It wasn't really untill we started meeting our customer in person, halfway in to the project, that we understood how much we had been talking past each other. There had been lacking clarity in messages between us and since both parts thought they understood each other, no measures where made. Now, after an almost four hour meeting with our customer in person, we finally came to an common understanding of what purpose the app had. This also meant that we suddenly was far behind schedule since we had to completely redo the product backlog based on the new feature list. We strongly feel that this list should have been provided to us at the beginning of the project. It would have saved us a lot of time.

That being said, we also take self criticism. There was for instance one incident where a team members didn't pay enough attention on a meeting. This resulted in him working almost 20 hours with trying to integrate the soundcloud UI experience into StedR. What our customer really wanted was for us to make a simple api call to the Soundcloud servers and retrieve sounds based on title. We of course take full responsibility for this. 


	\subsection{Project planning}


Our pre-study and project planning was really thorough, but in retrospective, much of it ended up being a waste. We spent a lot of time doing research and user tests, trying to figure out what direction we should take the app in. Because of the misunderstanding explained in Communication, we thought we had much more freedom than we actually had. We had the idea that we could just get creative and play with the app as we saw fit.

Its not that we have any problems of working with a predefined feature list, but then it should be clear that we in fact have these restraints.

In the first half of the project, these were some of the features we were working on that we later dismissed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Adding new places from the app
	\item Wikipedia integration - Possebility to see wiki entires related to the place you are visiting.
	\item Adding full Soundcloud experience in the app.
	\item Attaching NRK archive footage to a place. 
	\item General design overhaul. 
\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Problems and difficulty}

The development of this app have been quite a bumpy ride for us. We have stumbled upon surprisingly many problems from our risk analysis.

One could of course question our preventive abilities, but we still feel we took the right precautions. Some things are just left to luck.

From out risk analysis, this is some of the more important problems we came across in this project. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Communication failure - Between the team and the customer as explained in Communication.
	\item Major requirements change - The new feature list, which was given to us halfway into the project, changed the requirements a lot.
	\item Technical difficulties - We had huge trouble setting up the development environment for titanium framework. Two team members didn't even get it to work at all.
	\item Unavailability - Two team members spent 2 weeks in china which reduces our capacity right before easter. 
	\item Lack of Competence - Combined we had zero experience with the technologies used in this project beforehand.
	\item Sickness - As explained above.
	\item Equipment Failure - One team member had to send his computer to service for a total of 6 weeks. Two others had to replace their android device. 
\end{itemize}

This was also the first time for all of us to take over a project hallways to further develop it. We are not going to lie, this was little demotivating, but we managed to stay positive regardless. First of all, we didn't have the option to choose technologies based on our strengths since its already chosen by the previous group. Actually, none in our group had any experience with any of the technologies used. This was very unfortunate since we have to spend a lot of time to learn new frameworks. Additionally, you have the aspect of understanding all the code that had been written. 

	\subsection{Lesson learned}

In terms of management, we have learned some important lessons.

Firstly is the importance of clear milestones. In the beginning we had very unclear goals and this affected the group. It was later solved when we got a priority list from our cutomer. Working without a clear focus can be challenging for the team members.

Also, clearity internally. If we had been a bit more clear on responsibilities within the group, the development process would have gone more smoothly.

Lastly, we can not emphasis this enough: Communication is the key to every projects success. Of course we already knew this coming into the project, but in practice it is easy to lose focus. Because of a simple misunderstanding between two of our customers we spent two weeks working on the user interface and other irrelevant features, when we should have prioritised integrating API’s instead. So clearity on what the customer want is important. We also learned that Skype meetings or talking over the phone is not sufficient for good communication.
 
\subsection{Conclusion}

Even though we started of on the wrong foot, being both unfortunate and a little careless, we managed to pull ourself together and produce a result we are all proud of. All that is left now, is to hope our customer feels the same way. Either way, we have learn incredibly much from this project. We have stumbled across a fair amount of unlikely, but yet realistic problems that can occur in every working project. We feel that this valuable experience can help us avoid many of the same errors in the future.
