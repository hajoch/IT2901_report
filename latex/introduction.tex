This report is written as a bachelor project by computer science students at NTNU. The project revolves around upgrading and expanding features of a multi platform app called “Stedr” which is currently in beta. Stedr's purpose is to enable people to share their stories about places around the world. This can be anything from a famous attractions to just an ordinary building Trondheim. The contributors will be able to share stories and media through external services like Digitalt Fortalt, Flickr, Instagram, Soundcloud etc. With the application, users can view other peoples stories and images  to help them explore a certain place.

\subsection{The subject: IT2901}
\emph{IT2901: prosjektarbeid i informatikk} is the name of the course this project is a part of. Through this project the students will work in groups on a specific project within the scope of informatics. The institute will recomend chosen tasks for the students to choose from. From here the students work self-reliantly under the supervision of employees at the institute. \textit{(Text based on the information gathered from the study guide.)}\\ The main purpose of the project is for the students to aquire practical experience in the software engineering process. Through working with a real customer in a team throughout the entire process the student gain valueable experience to prepare them for their future carreers after the studies.

\subsection{Stedr}
The app “Stedr” are created by a previous group as a bachelor thesis, in the same subject, on the initiative from SINTEF. The goal of the app is to make room for a comunity of contributors to share stories about public places in their area, to be displayed in the app. 

\subsection{Stakeholders}
In this subsection we will present the main people involveld with the project. 

\subsubsection{The team}
The team consists of six students all taking a Bachelor degree in Informatics at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In our team we have a great variation in areas of expertise and knowledge which hpelped us greatly during the course of the project. Having expertise in many different areas we could help each other and share knowledge across the group to make everybody suited to different tasks. The importance of this project made the whole group very motivated to succeed and make for a good result.
We are:\\
