This report is written as a bachelor thesis by computer science students at NTNU. The project revolves around upgrading and expanding features of a multi platform app called “Stedr” which is currently in beta. Stedr's purpose is to enable people to share their stories about places around the world. This can be anything from a famous attractions to just an ordinary building Trondheim. The contributors will be able to share stories and media through external services like Digitalt Fortalt, Flickr, Instagram, Soundcloud etc. With the application, users can view other peoples stories and images  to help them explore a certain place.
