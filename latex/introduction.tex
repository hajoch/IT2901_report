\section{Introduction}
	\setcounter{page}{1}


This report is written as a bachelor thesis by computer science students at NTNU. The project revolves around upgrading and expanding features of a multi platform app called “Stedr” which is currently in beta. Stedr's purpose is to enable people to share their stories about places around the world. This can be anything from a famous attractions to just an ordinary building Trondheim. The contributors will be able to share stories and media through external services like Digitalt Fortalt, Flickr, Instagram, Soundcloud etc. With the application, users can view other peoples stories and images  to help them explore a certain place.

\subsubsection{The team}
The team consists of six students all taking a Bachelor degree in Informatics at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In our team we have a great variation in areas of expertise and knowledge which hpelped us greatly during the course of the project. Having expertise in many different areas we could help each other and share knowledge across the group to make everybody suited to different tasks. The importance of this project made the whole group very motivated to succeed and make for a good result.
